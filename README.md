# Branch Structure

- The **master** branch will be used to hold the currently working & tested version of the campaign
- The **develop** branch will be what developers/map creators/etc will make their feature branches off
- Feature branches will be merged into develop once they are tested
- Develop will be merged into master once a signficant set of features have been merged into develop and have been tested
